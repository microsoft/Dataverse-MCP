# üõ†Ô∏è Lab 01 - Setting up your Dataverse environment & install the Dataverse MCP Local Proxy
In this lab, you will learn how to setup a Dataverse environment so that you can use the Dataverse MCP Server. Also, you will learn how to install the Dataverse Model Context Protocol server.

## Provision Dataverse environment
Open `Terminal` or `PowerShell` on your machine in the `Run as Administrator` mode. Press the `Windows key` and type `Terminal`. Right-click and select **Run as Administrator**.

Get the Power Apps admin module by running the following command in the terminal:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name Microsoft.PowerApps.Administration.PowerShell
```

After completing this step, run following command (you can stay in the same Terminal/PowerShell window). You need to pass LocationName as "unitedstatesfirstrelease" and provide a friendly name for your environment. You will be prompted for your credentials, please remember which one you use to complete this step. You will need it for the configuration of the environment.

```powershell
New-AdminPowerAppEnvironment -DisplayName '<friendly name>' -Location unitedstatesfirstrelease -EnvironmentSku Trial -ProvisionDatabase
```

At successful run, you will see a list of attributes of your newly provisioned environment. This typically includes EnvironmentName, DisplayName, Location (expected value is unitedstatesfirstrelease), CommonDataServiceDatabaseProvisioningState (expected value is succeeded).
