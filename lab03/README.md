# üßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª Lab 03 - Use the Dataverse MCP server with Visual Studio Code

In this lab, you will learn about how to use the Dataverse MCP server with Visual Studio Code. This lab will build on the earlier labs, so make sure to finish those as well.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configure Visual Studio Code to use the Dataverse MCP server

If you don‚Äôt have VS Code installed, [download Visual Studio Code - Mac, Linux, Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

1. In VS Code, open the command palette using Ctrl+Shift+P or **View** > **Command Palette**. Type *MCP:* and a list of relevant MCP commands are displayed, such as MCP: List Servers and MCP: Add Servers.  
1. If you have configured the Dataverse MCP server as described earlier in the [Claude desktop](#configure-and-use-the-dataverse-mcp-server-in-claude) step and your VS Code MCP setting is set as `"chat.mcp.discovery.enabled": true`, VS Code is able to discover it. For example, when you choose **MCP: List Servers**, the MCP server, such as **Dataverse MCP Server Running**, is displayed.

   If the Dataverse MCP server isn't running, select the server and then select **Start Server**. Observe the server start in the **Output** window of VS Code.

### Configure the Dataverse MCP server in VS Code

These instructions help you configure a Dataverse MCP server at the user setting level.

1. In VS Code, go to **Manage** (gear on lower left) > **Settings** or CTRL+, and then type *MCP*.
1. **Mcp** is listed under the **User** tab. Select **Edit in settings.json**.
   ![Edit Mcp JSON in VS Code](./assets/mcp-edit-vsc.png)
1. Add the Dataverse MCP configuration text inside the mcp "servers" setting following the curly brace.
   ![JSON snippet location for MCP Dataverse](./assets/mcp-dataverse-json.png)

   ```json
   "Dataverse MCP Server": {
   "command": "Microsoft.PowerPlatform.Dataverse.MCP",
   "args": [
     "--ConnectionUrl",
     "<Connection URL>",
     "--MCPServerName",
     "DataverseMCPServer",
     "--TenantId",
     "<Tenant Id>",
     "--EnableHttpLogging",
     "true",
     "--EnableMsalLogging",
     "false",
     "--Debug",
     "false",
     "--BackendProtocol",
     "HTTP"
    ]
   }
   ```

1. Replace `<Connection URL>` and `<Tenant Id>`

> [!NOTE]
> When the MCP server is configured correctly in settings.json, you notice a status like **Start**. This means that syntactically, it's correct and you can start the MCP server. In case it doesn‚Äôt show Start, you can go to **Command Palette** (Ctrl+Shift+P), type *MCP:* and then select **MCP: List Servers**. You should see the Dataverse MCP server there.

In VS Code, open GitHub Copilot by selecting the **GitHub Copilot icon** or use **ctrl+alt+I**.

Change GitHub Copilot from ask mode to agent mode.

![Change from ask to agent mode](./assets/change-ask-agent-mode.png)

Now you can select the tools icon to open the available tools.

![Select tools](./assets/select-tools.png)

Depending on your extensions, the list can differ, but the **Dataverse MCP Server** should be listed with a text **from Claude Desktop** or if you manually added the MCP server to the settings, it should show without the `from Claude Desktop` text.

Make sure the tools are selected, and select **OK**.

## üß† Use the Dataverse MCP server tools

Let's start by asking again about the tables in Dataverse:

```
List tables from Dataverse
```

GitHub Copilot will ask you if you want to continue running the **list_tables** tool. 

![Confirm list_tables tool run](./assets/confirm-tool-run.png)

Select **Continue** and you should see something like the following response:

![List_tables tool response](./assets/list-tables-response.png)

Now, let's list the items in the contact table again by running the following prompt:

```
List items in the contact table
```

Select **Continue** to run the tools needed. It will return items, but it might not return all the items in the table. If that happens, make sure to ask for 10 items. That should return all 10 items.

```
Here are 10 records from the contact table:

Let me know if you need further assistance!
```

Let's update the contacts, since the country is not filled.

```
I forgot to add the country to the contacts in Dataverse. Can you please add the country United States to all 10 contacts?
```

This will update the items in our contacts table.

> [!NOTE]
> Depending on the model used, it can sometimes fail the update because of not having the correct contactid GUIDs. You can easily solve this by sending the prompt 'Please get the IDs from the contacts table'.

![](./assets/updated-items.png)

To verify the actions, run the following prompt:

```
Can you list all contacts in Dataverse with their respective countries?
```

This should lead to a response like this:

![List contacts with country](./assets/list-items-country.png)
